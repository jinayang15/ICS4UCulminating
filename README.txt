

What we did:

- Pokemon statistics!
	- Base stats of every Pokemon we have is the same as the real deal.
	- The type system works, with some Pokemon having multiple types!

- Got the battle system to work! 
	- Type advantages work, with attacks doing 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x, or even 4x! 
	- Status moves work! 

Stuff we couldn't do:
- No items 
- No Pokemon Center to heal (instead, Pokemon is healed after every battle)
- No Pokemart 




Bugs:
- Collision in the town. If you go RIGHT beside a building, you will get stuck. However, if you move slightly
  away from it, 
- Sometimes when you go into battle, the images are bugged. The text field part may get super blown up, etc. 
  - A reload usually fixes this.
